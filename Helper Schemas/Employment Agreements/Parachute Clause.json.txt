You will be provided a document from which you need to identify the presence of a parachute clause. This is a clause which addresses termination of the employee only in the event of merger, acquisition, change in control or other significant corporate change in the employer's company/ organization. The parachute clause would require, in such an event, that the employer provide the employee with a specified payout or other benefits (like severance pay, cash bonuses, stock options, etc.) if the employee is terminated/ forced out by the employer before the end of the contract term. Such a clause may make reference to 'parachute', 'golden parachute', or 'silver parachute' but this is not necessary. Do not confuse this with a termination clause which is unrelated to the situations or events expressly mentioned herein.",

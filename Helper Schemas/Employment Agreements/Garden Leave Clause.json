You will be provided a document from which you need to identify the presence of a garden leave clause. A clause will qualify as a garden leave clause either if it is explicitly referred to as 'garden leave' in the document, or if it satisfies these two essential elements: it must state that (1) during the notice period or after the employment period is over, the employee shall not work for the employer's competition for a specific duration, and (2) the employee will continue to receive the regular salary and/ or benefits from the employer during such duration. Both of these elements are necessary prerequisites and must be satisfied. Hence, if the clause does not provide for salary or benefits during such period, then the clause is not a garden leave clause. Do not confuse a garden leave clause with a simple non-compete clause where there is no obligation on the employer to provide salary or benefits in exchange for the restraint of trade.",

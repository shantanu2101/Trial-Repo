What threshold of consent is required among lenders for taking any decisions under the document and granting any consents, waivers, approvals, etc., under the document? (b) Is there a list of items for which consent of all lenders is required? (c) Is there a list of items for which consent of a majority of lenders is required? (d) Are there any decisions/actions that each lender can take individually and severally?",

These provisions are referred to colloquially as ‘majority lender construct’ or ‘inter-creditor provisions’ – i.e., in case a decision needs to be made among the lenders, how is this to be done? Is there a majority threshold among the lenders? Do all lenders need to approve all actions/consents? Are there certain actions that each lender can individually and severally decide upon?\n Restrict yourself to explicit clauses in the <document> to this effect, and do not make any inferences. Mention the specific clause number/clause title for each response.",

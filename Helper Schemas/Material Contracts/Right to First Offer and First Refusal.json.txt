Right to firstoffer, or 'ROFO', is a provision which gives the right holder an optionto make an offer or bid on an asset before the owner attempts to sell/offer it to a third party. On the other hand, right to first refusal, or'ROFR', is a provision which gives the right holder an option to matchor refuse an offer already made by a third party on an asset before theowner can sell it. The concerned asset may be in the form of property,shares etc. Hence, ROFO strikes before an offer is made by a thirdparty, while ROFR strikes after an offer is made by a third party. Do not confuse right to first offer with right to first refusal.",

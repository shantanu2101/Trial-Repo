Firstly, there is an 'auto-renewal'/ 'automatic renewal' clause, which states that at the end of the contract term, the agreement will automatically renew unless one of the parties has terminated or wishes to terminate it. Secondly, there is an 'option to renew' clause, which states that at the end of the contract term, the party/ parties have the option to renew the contract on certain terms, if they wish to do so. Thirdly, there is a 'no renewal' clause, which states that the contract is a one-time agreement which shall not be renewed. Unlike the 'option to renew' clause, the 'auto renewal' clause does not require any positive action by either party in order to renew the contract. Do not confuse between these three types of renewal provisions. Identify each of these three types independently in the document provided.",

You will be provided a contract from which you need to identify the presence of a damages or liquidated damages clause. This is different from an indemnity clause, and must never be confused. This is also different from a 'limitation of liability' clause, and must never be confused. A limitation of liability clause is a clause which states that the party/parties shall not be liable for damages which are incidental, special, consequential, punitive, etc. in nature. This is different from a damages or liquidated damages clause. Never confuse a damages/ liquidated damages clause with a limitation of liability clause. Do not, under any circumstance, include any reference to a limitation of liability clause or indemnity clause.",

Form PAS-3 is used for communicating to theRegistrar of Companies the details of the securities issued by thecompany. As a legal expert, if you come across a PAS-3 filing pertainingto issuance of securities other than equity shares (i.e., for preferenceshares, DVR shares, or debentures), then you are particularly interestedin what special terms and conditions govern these special classes ofinstruments. For instance, for preference shares, you want to understandthe preferred dividend and liquidation rights available to theshareholders, the conversion terms in relation to the shares,interest/coupon rate, and any other such special terms and conditionsattached to such DVR shares. For DVR shares, you want to understand thedifferential voting rights and any other special terms and conditionsattached to such DVR shares. For debentures, you want to understand theconvertibility of the debentures (and the terms of such convertibility,if applicable), the interest/coupon rate, and any other special termsand conditions attached to the debentures. You know that due to theprescribed format of the primary form PAS-3, a lot of this informationmay be present only in the attachments appended towards the end of theform PAS-3. You are also aware that much of this information may becontained in tabular format.",

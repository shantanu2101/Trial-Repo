Make sure your response sets out the date of the board/general meeting (i.e., the date on which the resolution is passed) as set out in the subject line of the resolution attached to the document (if any) through which the director/KMP is appointed. Do not mention any other date and do not confuse this with the effective dateof appointment. If either of the two dates is not expressly mentioned in the TITLE of the resolutions attached to the document, just say that it is not mentioned. If the document does not pertain to appointment of director/KMP and instead deals with cessation, etc., then simply mention that the document does not pertain to appointment of KMP.

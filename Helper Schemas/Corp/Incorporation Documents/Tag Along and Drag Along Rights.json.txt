You will be provided a document from which you have toidentify the presence of tag along rights and drag along rights. Tag along rights are provisions which entitle the minority shareholder to take part in a sale of shares by the majority shareholder to a thirdparty. On the other hand, drag along rights are provisions which enablea majority shareholder to force a minority shareholder to join in thesale of shares to a third party. Hence, while a tag along provisioncreates a right on the minority shareholders, a drag along provisioncreates a right on the majority shareholders. Do not confuse tag alongrights with drag along rights.",
